                <p>#1 Stephen Curry is the best shooter in the game of basketball and arguably one of the best to play. What makes him the best shooter ever, is that he shoot at high and consistent shooting rate. His release is also very quick making it hard to block. He can be argued as the best player ever to play basketball because he made his whole team better around him. He also has two MVP trophies. You can't forget about the NBA championship ring!!! Now lets talk about off the court. He's a very respectful men that also praises god. He's also an very good father and husband to his family. Lastly he also gives back to the people. #FutreHallOFFame</p>

                <p>#2 Damian Lillard is my second favorite player just because the fact he plays with so much passion and heart. He also seems to be a very loyal guy as you can see after all of his teammates left him. He's also makes players around him better and you can see by statistics. Example of someone who plays very well along side him CJ Mcollum. He's also a very good scorer on and off the ball. He can shoot very well and is one of the most clutch players in the NBA. he carries himself well off the court aswell, which is pretty good because you dont hear negative things about his personal life. Further more his only talent isn't basketball, he can also rap. You can check him out on youtube.#FutreHallOFFame </p>

                <p>Jamal crawford Mr. Take your ankles, Mr.Sixth man of the year, Mr. Four point play. He has been giving so many nicknames that i can't remember. He can be in the top 20 best players to ever play the game if was to be a starter. I belive if he was to start and played thirty plus minutes, he'll be the top scorer. Also would have multiple MVP trophies. He's a terrific role modle for kids, he's never talked negative about on socail media or etc. He's also doing positives things in his life. He should be in the hall of fame when he retire. </p>

                <p>Kevin Durant is probably the best all-around player to ever play the game. He can pass, play defense, rebound, and also score at will. He is already known as one of the greats. His journey to where he is now is amazing. When you hear about the stories you relize why he's so good and play with so much passion. He's also a player that loves to give back. Durant once had the highest paying shoe contract with nike. </p>
